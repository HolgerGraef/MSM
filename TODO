"saved commit message" => TODO: check if this still applies and ideally sort out issues
======================

Bernardo Castilho's polyfill works, but it would be (much) better if
there were a drag delay / minimum distance for mobile

dropping in new action CKEditor does not work on mobile, but it does
in the inline editor (on PC it works either way)

the alternative is to switch completely to the jQuery UI drag and drop
combined with jQuery UI Touch Punch, but then I will have to change a
lot of things, including the behaviour when we cancel dragging (put
item back where it was), the "phantom item" etc.

we can also say we do not implement drag and drop on tablet, but we need
a way to change samples parent, THIS WOULD BE USEFUL either way, in
case dragging and dropping becomes annoying

how about the automatic link creation in this case?
